# Background

I have always wanted a tool to compare the performance of investment in regular investing and lump sum investment.

Although I mainly focus on crypto, of course, you can change the parameters to any asset you want to follow.

# Notes

Obviously, for wizards who can predict the future, the lump sum investment is better, Most people think of themselves as wizards.

If you treat unused cash as buying put options at a very low cost, regular investing is not a poor strategy.
